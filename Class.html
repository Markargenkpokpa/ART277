  <h2 style="font-family:Times New Roman; color:lime ">What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
  
    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
    <u style="color: yellow"><b style="color: lime">Aldus PageMaker</b></u> includingversions of <u style="color: yellow">Lorem Ipsum</u>. 1914 translation by H. Rackham </p><br/>
    
    <p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was
    born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the
    great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or
    avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
    pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone
    who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
    circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.</p><br>
    
    <h2 style="color: lime"> why do we use it?</h2>
    
    <p>  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
    layout. The point of using <u style="color: lime">Lorem Ipsum</u>is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
    using “Content here, content here”, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and
    web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem Ipsum” will uncover
    many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,
    sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).  </p>
    
    <h2 style="color: lime">where can I get it?</h2>
    
    <p>  <b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
    alteration in some form, by injected humour, or <u style="color:lime">randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly
    believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
    embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
    predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over
    200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
    reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non￾characteristic words etc.  </p>
